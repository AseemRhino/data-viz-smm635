# SMM635, Data Visualisation --- Mid-Term Project Description

## Project Context

Climate change is a significant problem as it puts ecosystems in danger,
changes weather patterns, and speeds up rising sea levels. This has a severe
impact on agriculture, human health, and socio-economic stability. It is
essential to take urgent action to reduce its effects and transition to a
sustainable future. This will ensure the well-being of current and future
generations and the planet's health. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to
assess the progress made so far in mitigating climate change. A thorough,
data-driven approach can help clarify the patterns of climate change actions
over time and their associations with country-level variables.

##  Dataset

A panel dataset was produced by a 2022 TrueCue-hosted data hackathon,
containing the sustainability metrics of 173 countries over 19 years. This
dataset is available for download at Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/truecue/worldsustainabilitydataset, and a
companion file named 'Data Dictionary.xlsx' illustrates the dataset's fields.

## Expectations

The students are expected to use the knowledge they acquired in SMM635 to
address the following questions:

1. How has the pattern of climate change actions varied over time?

2. How does the pattern of climate change actions change across countries?
   What economic and social variables account for the inter-country variation?

3. Are there any countries that have significantly changed their climate
   change actions over time?

# Deliverables

1. Visualization Report (use the template)

2. Presentation to c-levels based on the visualization report

3. Code(both .pdf and .ipynb format) : able to reproduce the results incldued in the visualization report

Good luck! ü§ûüçÄ
