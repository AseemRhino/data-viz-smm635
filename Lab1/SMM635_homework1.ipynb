    "In my experience, the best way to do this is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Along the top of your notebook, select \"Export\" (it might be in the three-dot menu at the top of the notebook in the same bar as the `+ Code` button and the `+ Markdown` button).\n",
    "2. Choose \"HTML\" and **save it next to this notebook file**. This is important because any images in the HTML have relative file paths that are set up to be in reference to the location of your notebook, so if you save it somewhere else, when you open it you may lose all your images. \n",
    "3. Open that HTML in your normal web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc), **not** in VS Code.\n",
    "4. Print the page to PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this instead of choosing the PDF option when exporting? If you try and export a notebook directly to PDF, VS Code will actually try and use a tool to convert it to a LaTeX document, compile that latex document, then print, and getting this setup right can be a pain, and the LaTeX conversion often causes problems. So while a little convoluted, that's my recommendation. "
